# Social_Ads_Prediction
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict whether a user will purchase a product after clicking on a social network advertisement. The primary goal is to help businesses, such as a car company, optimize their ad targeting strategies by identifying users most likely to convert based on key demographic features

Objective
To develop a predictive model using supervised machine learning algorithms that can determine the likelihood of a user making a purchase after seeing a targeted ad on a social media platform (assumed to be Facebook for this project).
